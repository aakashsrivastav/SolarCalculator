One of the crucial elements of pursuing Photography is understanding to use Earth's natural light sources ( Sun and Moon ) to our advantage. A trick to naturally take better photographs is to shoot in the Golden Hour. As the name suggests this begins approximately an hour before sunset.  In order to assist Photographers with planning of their photoshoots, we'll build an Application that provides Rising &amp; Setting time of Sun and the Moon. Rising &amp; Setting time will be referred to as Phasetime hereafter.  Phasetime can be calculated using an Algorithm. Implementation requires a date and location ( longitude and latitude ) as an input. User can provide the desired location using a Search Bar, move the Red pin or the Application will use current GPS location as default. For quick access, Application will be able to show past persisted locations by the user.

Expectations
Requisite permissions for accessing features should be obtained from the User providing proper rationalle.
Generate a System tray notification at the start of the Golden Hour

Bonus (In Progress)
Plot lines ( As shown in Mockup ) according to Rising / Setting directions of Sun and the Moon.
